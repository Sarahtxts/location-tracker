## 🚀 **OPEN YOUR APP NOW:**

http://localhost:3001
```

**That's your Location Tracker app!** 🎯

---

## 📝 **What Happened:**

1. ✅ Backend started successfully on port 5000 (SQLite database)
2. ✅ Frontend started on port 3001 (Vite automatically chose this port)
3. ✅ Everything is connected and ready to use!

---

## 💡 **Why Port 3001?**

Vite tried to use port 3000, but it was already in use, so it automatically picked port 3001. This is normal and works perfectly!

---

### **To Use the App:**
Open browser → `http://localhost:3001`

### **Backend API:**
Running on `http://localhost:5000` (you don't need to access this directly)

### **Database:**
SQLite file: `location-tracker-backend/locationTracker.db`

---

## 🔧 **If You Need to Restart:**

### **Stop Servers:**
